# Automated Crack Detection Using Deep Learning on Synthetic Thermogram Datasets

## Overview

This project focuses on developing an automated crack detection system using deep learning techniques on synthetic thermogram datasets. The work was conducted as part of a Bachelor thesis at IIT Bombay under the guidance of Prof. Dnyanesh Pawaskar. It includes a comprehensive study of existing crack detection methods, the creation of synthetic data for training, and the implementation of advanced deep learning models for accurate crack detection.

## Project Components

### `Deep Learning Codes`

Contains the codebase for deep learning models and experiments. This includes the implementation of the Mask RCNN model using the Detectron2 framework, scripts for training, fine-tuning, and evaluating the model on the synthetic datasets.

### `Final Ppt and Reports`

Includes the final presentation and reports summarizing the research, methodology, and results of the project. This section provides an overview of the entire project, including key findings and contributions.

### `MATLAB Simulations`

Features the MATLAB scripts and functions used to generate synthetic thermogram datasets. This includes the randomized Finite Element Simulation pipeline that creates temperature profiles for plates with cracks, considering various boundary conditions.

### `STL Files`

Contains the STL files used for the 3D modeling of plates in the finite element simulations. These files represent different geometries and crack configurations for generating diverse thermogram datasets.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
